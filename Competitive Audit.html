                    Does it have sound and animation to capture the user's attention? 
                    Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?

                    Kahoot is a very engaging app. It has gamification elements like score, learderboard 
                    and streaks to motivate the partisapents into getting the answers right. The use of
                    colors, sound effects and music keep the users engaged. The use of the "fire" system
                    in Kahoot makes the experience even more engaging by making people want to keep 
                    getting answers right. (9 / 10)

                    Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user's progress? 
                    Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? 
                    Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?
                </td>
                <td>
                    Kahoot only tracks your score and placement in the game you are currently in.
                    In my opinion this works for Kahoot since it has an endless amount of topics you
                    can learn. The only feedback Kahoot gives is if you were right or wrong.
                    It doesn't use user data to give a personalize experience but you can choose which
                    quizes you would like to do. (5 / 10)

                    User experience: How user-friendly is the app? 
                    Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear instructions and prompts? 
                    Does it have a well-designed interface?

                <td>
                    Kahoot, in my opinion has a user-friendly interface which is easy to navigate.
                    Kahoot has labels on everything and the more important aspects are bigger than the
                    not as important ones. It also gives examples of quizes the user can do in the 
                    discover tab which is very good for newer users.
